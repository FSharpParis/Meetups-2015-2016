# Tennis Kata

We've met on this Wednesday morning to practice F# with the Tennis Kata. Unlike Mark Seemann during his talk ([https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/FSharp-Events/fsharpConf-2016/Types-Properties-Software](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/FSharp-Events/fsharpConf-2016/Types-Properties-Software)), we haven't focused our work on "making illegal state non representable" but mor on a event-sourced way of counting score fro events.

The code we've written is available in this folder in a single half-French / half-English script.
